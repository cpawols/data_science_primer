# Data Science Primer

People approach data science from various angles. Mine was: a major in Sociology, previous exposure to basic statistics and a lot of hobby programming, working with Unix-like systems etc.

Given my background, I list a number of sources which were the most helpful from my point of view. This list does not contain everything that I have ever read on the subject, *only the beginner-friendly stuff*.

Due to the data science hype, the Web is full of _become a data scientist over a weekend_ materials. This site promises something else: you'll provided with studying materials for years to come.

## Mathematics

We start with mathematics, although some of the materials listed later on don't assume much of mathematical flucency. Feel free to move to the more fancy materials and revisit the basics as needed.
