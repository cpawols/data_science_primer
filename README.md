# Data Science Primer

People are approaching data science from varying starting points. Mine was: a major in Sociology, previous exposure to basic statistics and a lot of hobby programming, working with Unix-like systems etc.

Given my background, I list a number of sources which were the most helpful from my point of view. This list does not contain everything that I have ever read on the subject, only the beginner-friendly stuff.
