# Data Science Primer

People approach data science from various angles. Mine was: a major in Sociology, previous exposure to basic statistics and a lot of hobby programming, working with Unix-like systems etc.

Still, having no real technical background, I managed to get an industry job after more than a year of intensive study. Here I list a number of sources which were the most helpful in my professional conversion. This list does not contain everything that I have ever read on the subject, **only the beginner-friendly stuff**.

Due to the data science hype, the Web is full of _become a data scientist over a weekend_ materials. This site promises something else: you'll be provided with studying materials for years to come.

## Mathematics

We start with mathematics, although some of the materials listed later on don't assume much of mathematical flucency. Feel free to move to the more fancy stuff and revisit the basics as needed. For instance, you could start with [Andrew Ng's excellent _Machine learning_ course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) to develop basic mathematical intuitions, and then return to the materials listed here to solidify your understanding.

### Calculus

* \[[mooc](https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus1)\] _Calculus One_ by Jim Fowler
* \[[book](http://www.amazon.com/Pre-calculus-Demystified-Second-Rhonda-Huettenmueller/dp/0071778497)\] _Pre-calculus Demystified_ by Rhonda Huettenmueller - the book offers a concise refresher with enough exercies (with answers!) to get you back on track with high-school-level math.
* \[[book](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Early-Transcendentals-James-Stewart/dp/0495011665)\] _Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ by James Stewart - James Steward became a millionaire by writing calculus books, and there's a good reason for that.

### Linear algebra

* \[[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL01A21B9E302D50C1)\] _WildLinAlg: A geometric course in Linear Algebra_ by Norman J. Wildberger

### Statistics


## Model thinking

In the data science trend there's too much focus on data and not enough on science. Make sure that you're fluent with the building blocks of science, namely: models. The sources below provide a really gentle introduction into these little creatures.

* \[[mooc](https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking/home/welcome)\] _Model thinking_ by Scott Page
* \[[book](http://www.amazon.com/Modeling-Reality-Computers-Mirror-CD-ROM/dp/0198531001)\] \[[homepage](http://www.modelingreality.net/)\] Modeling Reality: How Computers Mirror Life by Iwo Białynicki-Birula and Iwona Białynicka-Birula




## Data analysis

### Data wrangling

* \[[book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)\] _Python for Data Analysis_ by Wes McKinney

### Data mining

### Machine learning

* \[[mooc](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)\] _Machine learning_ by Andrew Ng
* \[[book](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)\] _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani

### Neural networks

* \[[book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)\] _Neural networks and deep learning_ by Michael Nielsen
* \[[on-line materials](http://cs231n.github.io/)\] _CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition_ by Andrej Karpathy

### Big data

* \[[mooc](https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci)\] _Introduction to Data Science_ by Bill Howe - a nice intro with a well balanced approach to SQL versus NoSQL solutions
* \[[book](http://www.mmds.org/)\] \[[mooc](https://www.coursera.org/course/mmds)\] _Mining of Massive Datasets_ by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, Jeff Ullman



## Databases

* \[[mooc](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101P/about)\] _M101P: MongoDB for Developers_ by Andrew Erlichson


## Programming

Given my prior experience in programming (almost 15 years of hobby coding) I am not the best source of recommendations for beginners in this area. If you're starting with programming you should go somewhere else for advice. However, if your aim is to advance from amateur programmer (which often applies to data scientists) to a professional, these links will help you. 

### Algorithms

* \[[book](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X)\] \[[online version](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)\] by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

### Software engineering


### Java


### Python
