# Data Science Primer

People approach data science from various angles. Mine was: a major in Sociology, previous exposure to basic statistics and a lot of hobby programming, working with Unix-like systems etc.

Still, having no real technical background, I managed to get an industry job after more than a year of intensive study. Here I list a number of sources which were the most helpful in my professional conversion. This list does not contain everything that I have ever read on the subject, **only the beginner-friendly stuff**.

Due to the data science hype, the Web is full of _become a data scientist over a weekend_ materials. This site promises something else: you'll be provided with studying materials for years to come.

## Mathematics

We start with mathematics, although some of the materials listed later on don't assume much of mathematical flucency. Feel free to move to the more fancy stuff and revisit the basics as needed. For instance, you could start with [Andrew Ng's excellent _Machine learning_ course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) to develop basic mathematical intuitions, and then return to the materials listed here to solidify your understanding.

### Calculus

* \[[book](http://www.amazon.com/Pre-calculus-Demystified-Second-Rhonda-Huettenmueller/dp/0071778497)\] _Pre-calculus Demystified_ by Rhonda Huettenmueller - the book offers a concise refresher with enough exercies (with answers!) to get you back on track with high-school-level math.
* \[[book](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Early-Transcendentals-James-Stewart/dp/0495011665)\] _Calculus: Early Transcendentals_ by James Stewart - James Steward became a millionaire by writing calculus books, and there's a good reason for that.

### Linear algebra

* \[[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL01A21B9E302D50C1)\] _WildLinAlg: A geometric course in Linear Algebra_ by Norman J. Wildberger

### Statistics


## Data analysis

### Data wrangling
